Refactoring Hyperparameters in src/model.py:

* Replaced hardcoded global hyperparameters with a `GPTConfig` dataclass.
* Updated `GPTLanguageModel`, `Block`, `MultiHeadAttention`, `Head`, and `FeedFoward` to accept a `config` object instead of relying on global variables.
* This improves maintainability and reusability, allowing different model configurations to be instantiated easily.
* The refactoring required updates to `src/engine.py` and `src/main.py` to instantiate the model with a configuration object.
* `src/model.py` was also rescued from a corrupted state where it contained a shell script. The content was split into `src/data.py`, `src/engine.py`, and `src/main.py`.
